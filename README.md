- **`Song.java`**, **`Album.java`**, **`Playlist.java`**  
  Basic objects for songs (title, artist, rating), albums (year, genre, tracklist), and playlists.  
- **`LibraryModel.java`**  
  Manages your library â€“ adds songs/albums, handles searches, playlists, and ratings.  

### `/src/main/view`
